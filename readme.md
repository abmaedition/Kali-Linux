# This is a testing of openSSH:
. the example is amazing, but the steps are too much
. you need to make sure the ssh-agent is active whenever you want to use this feature.
. The process needs to be done for another account to make sure multiple accounts can work the same way.
. The process will be repeated couple of times before ensuring the full understanding of the process.
. please make sure to repeat the process as many times as you can.
# The goal of learning SSH:
. there are times when you want to work on different accounts at the same time, and the best thing here is to enable ssh
. https authentication token permits only one connection.
# has it been useful?
. So far, it is amazing to do something and see it work.
